<h1>Tips</h1>
<h2>Restarting the server</h2>

<br>

<p>When you make changes to any JavaScript files, you have to restart the server. Just press `ctrl + c` in the terminal to stop the server and `npm start` or `node ./bin/www` to start it up again. This process can get very tedious, so I highly recommend that you install Nodemon. This package will automatically restart your server every time you make changes to your JS files. All you have to do is run `sudo npm install -g nodemon` to install the package globally and then run `nodemon ./bin/www`. The package takes care of the rest!</p>
